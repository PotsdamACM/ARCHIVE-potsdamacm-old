## Requirements
In order to work on the site at its current state you need:
* A modern web browser *(Duh!)*
* Sass installed on your computer *(Visit [Sass's official site](http://sass-lang.com/) to learn more.)*

Bootstrap, fonts and icons should be linked to the files already. If you are making another page **Link with MaxCDN if possible** *(For [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/) and [Fontawesome](http://fontawesome.io/get-started/))*

## Notes
Also, make sure if you decide to use a third party technology in this project, such as a font or tool, please make sure to **read the license** that comes with it, to ensure proper use and attribution if required.

Code should be written to conform to the [Google Style Guide for html/css](http://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.xml).
